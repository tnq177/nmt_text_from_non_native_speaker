# Transformer in Pytorch

Source code for the Transformer model used in the paper "Neural Machine Translation of Text from Non-Native Speakers" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06267](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06267).  

Pretty much just the transformer model, but the validator validates on different dev sets at a time and keeps best checkpoint for each dev set.
